This code performs computations whose results are mentioned in the article.
(None of these computations is essential.)

finite_abelian_quotient.gap
    This takes the possible 4-relator presentation for Z^2 in the case of
    m = 3 and n = 4, makes the orders of the generators divide 24, and then
    verifies that the quotient is abelian.

m_n_two_odd.gap
    This verifies for m=2 and small odd n that the 4-relator presentation
    does indeed define Z^2.

relation_module.magma
    This shows that the aforementioned 4 relators generate the derived
    subgroup of the free group of rank 2 as a Z[Z^2] module.

small_groups_check.gap
    This determines the smallest group which does not satisfy some law which
    its power subgroups satisfy, checks another small example, and then
    determines the smallest non-metabelian groups with metabelian coprime
    power subgroups.
